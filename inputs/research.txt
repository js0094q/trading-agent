## 1) Executive Summary (30 seconds)
- **Regime (Trend vs Chop):** **Trend / Chop / Mixed**  
  - **Why:** *(e.g., index above VWAP, higher highs/lows, breadth strong; or mean-reverting tape with failed breakouts)*  
- **Volatility Regime:** **Low / Normal / Elevated**  
  - **Proxy:** *(e.g., ATR(14) vs 20d average, VIX proxy if used, intraday range expansion)*  
- **Today’s Edge (if any):** *(e.g., breakouts favored, mean reversion favored, avoid mid-day)*  
- **Key Risk:** *(e.g., catalyst-heavy day, liquidity thinning, large gaps, headline risk)*

## 2) Conditions That Favor the Strategy Today
### 2.1 Trend-Favorable Conditions (green lights)
- **Market structure:** *(e.g., index holding above VWAP, clean ORB break + retest)*  
- **Breadth/participation:** *(e.g., adv/dec positive, sector leaders confirming)*  
- **Volatility behavior:** *(e.g., range expansion with follow-through, not whipsaw)*  
- **Liquidity:** *(e.g., tight spreads, stable depth, consistent prints)*

### 2.2 Chop-Favorable Conditions (yellow lights)
- **Market structure:** *(e.g., repeated VWAP crosses, failed breakouts, inside day)*  
- **Volatility behavior:** *(e.g., compressed ranges, quick reversals)*  
- **Implication:** Prefer mean reversion setups, smaller targets, faster time-stops.

### 2.3 Red Flags (no-trade or reduce aggression)
- **Event risk windows:** *(e.g., Fed, CPI, earnings cluster, major macro headlines)*  
- **Microstructure:** spreads widening, thin book, large hidden liquidity games  
- **Tape behavior:** wick-heavy candles, frequent stop-runs, low follow-through  
- **Gaps:** large gap into major level without stabilization

## 3) Market Regime Diagnostics (inputs → inference)
> Label each as **Data** or **Inference**.

### 3.1 Index Context (SPY/QQQ/IWM or relevant benchmark)

  - Prior day range: __  
  - Today gap: __%  
  - Premarket high/low: __ / __  
  - VWAP posture: *(above/below/around)*  
  - Key levels: prior H/L, overnight H/L, weekly pivots

- **Inference:**  
  - **Bias:** trend continuation / mean reversion / balanced

|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ____ | ____ | Vol: __ / Spread: __ | ONH/ONL, PDH/PDL, VWAP, HTF lvl | Trend/Chop | ____ |
| 2 | ____ | ____ | Vol: __ / Spread: __ | ____ | Trend/Chop | ____ |
| 3 | ____ | ____ | Vol: __ / Spread: __ | ____ | Trend/Chop | ____ |

### 5.2 Per-Symbol Quick Notes (optional, 3–5 bullets each)
#### SYMBOL: ____
- **Why on list:** *(clean level, RVol, catalyst, sector strength)*  
- **Key levels:** ONH/ONL, PDH/PDL, VWAP, HTF level  
- **What would invalidate tradability:** *(spread widens, volume fades, messy tape)*  
- **Special caution:** *(halts, wide options spreads, low float, news sensitivity)*

## 6) “If-Then” Board Preparation (no trades, only scenarios)
### Scenario A: Trend Day Developing
- **If:** index holds above VWAP and expands range with breadth confirmation  
- **Then:** prioritize trend-fit names, avoid fading strength, widen time-stop tolerance.

### Scenario B: Chop / Mean Reversion Day
- **If:** repeated VWAP crossings, failed breakouts, narrow range  
- **Then:** prioritize mean-reversion candidates, smaller targets, faster exits.

### Scenario C: Event-Driven Volatility
- **If:** major event within next __ minutes  
- **Then:** avoid new risk, reduce exposure, wait for post-event structure.
